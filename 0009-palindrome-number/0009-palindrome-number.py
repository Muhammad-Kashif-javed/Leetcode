'''Time Complexity:

The key operation happens inside the while num > 0: loop.
In each iteration, you divide num by 10 (num = num // 10).
Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in x.
The number of digits in a number x is approximately log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(x).
(Because if x has d digits, then 10^(d-1) <= x < 10^d.)
Thus, the time complexity is:ùëÇ(log10(ùë•)) or O(log(x))
‚ÄãSpace Complexity:
You use a few integer variables (num, revnum, last_digit), but no extra space that grows with input size.
Thus, space complexity is: ùëÇ(1)'''
